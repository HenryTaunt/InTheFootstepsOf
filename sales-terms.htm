      <p><strong> Our contract</strong></p>
      <p> When you place an order to purchase a product from us, we will send you an e-mail confirming receipt of your order and containing the details of your order. Your order represents an offer to us to purchase a product which is accepted by us when we send e-mail confirmation to you that we've dispatched that product to you. That acceptance will be complete at the time we send the Dispatch Confirmation E-mail to you. Any products on the same order which we have not confirmed in a Dispatch Confirmation E-mail to have been dispatched do not form part of that contract. </p>
      <p><strong> Returns</strong></p>
      <p> Our returns policy applies to products purchased from us. In addition to your 30-day returns guarantee, customers in the European Union are entitled to a statutory cooling-off period of seven business days. </p>
      <p><strong> Thinking of returning an item?</strong></p>
      <p> To ensure the safe return of your items and the correct allocation of the items to your order, please follow the guidelines below: </p>
      <ul><li> Please include the payslip (the original or a copy) or a piece of paper with the name of the person who ordered the items, the order number and the reason for the return. </li>
        <li> Please use the original package to return the item. </li>
        <li> Please include the name of the person who ordered the items and the order number in the sender field on the package. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong> Our 30-day returns guarantee</strong></p>
      <p> Our 30-day returns guarantee means that if for any reason you are unhappy with your purchase, you can return it to us in its original condition within 30 days of the date you received the item,  and we will issue a full refund for the price you paid for the item. We can only accept the return of opened items if they are faulty. </p>
      <p> We are unable to exchange items that are not damaged, defective or incorrect </p>
      <p> In the event of us sending you a replacement for a damaged, defective or wrong item, you must return the item to us within 30 days. We reserve the right to charge the price of the replacement item to the payment card used for the original order if you do not return the original item to us within 30 days of the date on which we confirm we will issue a replacement. </p>
      <p>This returns policy does not affect your statutory rights.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p><strong> Your Statutory Rights</strong></p>
      <p><strong> Cooling-off Period</strong></p>
      <p> We want you to be delighted every time you shop with us. Occasionally though, we know you may want to return items. That's why under our 30-day returns guarantee, if for any reason you are unhappy with your purchase, you can return it to us in its original condition within 30 days of the date you received the item. </p>
      <p> By law, customers in the European Union also have the right to withdraw from the purchase of an item within seven working days of the day after the date the item is delivered. This applies to all of our products. </p>
      <p> To cancel your purchase within the seven-working-day cooling-off period, please package the relevant item(s) securely and send it to us  so that we receive it within seven working days of the day after the date that the item was delivered to you, enclosing a note as to the reason for the return as &quot;I just don't want it anymore&quot;.. </p>
      <p> Please note that we cannot accept returns if you deliver them to us by hand. </p>
      <p> For your protection, we recommend that you use a recorded-delivery service if the value of the return is more than 50 GBP. </p>
      <p> Please note that you will be responsible for the costs of returning the items to us unless we delivered the item to you in error, or if the item is damaged or defective. If we do not receive the item back from you with the delivery slip, we may arrange for collection of the item from your residence at your cost. </p>
      <p> As soon as we receive notice of your cancellation of this order, we will refund the relevant part of the purchase price for that item together with the item's normal postage charge--we cannot refund any priority, express or courier component of the postage charge. For more information on your right to withdraw from your purchase within the seven working day cooling-off period, visit the Department of Trade and Industry's website at: <span class="link2"><a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/consumers/buying-selling/distance-selling/index.html">http://www.dti.gov.uk/consumers/buying-selling/distance-selling/index.html</a></span></p>
      <p><strong> Other statutory rights</strong></p>
      <p> For more information about your other statutory rights, please visit the Department of Trade and Industry's Consumer Gateway website at: <span class="link2"><a href="http://www.consumer.gov.uk/consumer_web/shopping.htm#4">http://www.consumer.gov.uk/consumer_web/shopping.htm#4</a></span></p>
      <p><strong> Customs</strong></p>
      <p> When ordering goods from us for delivery overseas you may be subject to import duties and taxes, which are levied once the package reaches the specified destination. Any additional charges for customs clearance must be borne by you; we have no control over these charges and cannot predict what they may be. Customs policies vary widely from country to country, so you should contact your local customs office for further information. Additionally, please note that when ordering from us, you are considered the importer of record and must comply with all laws and regulations of the country in which you are receiving the goods. Your privacy is important to us and we know that you care about how information about your order is used and shared. We would like our international customers and customers dispatching products internationally to be aware that cross-border deliveries are subject to opening and inspection by customs authorities. </p>
      <p><strong> Events beyond our reasonable control</strong></p>
      <p> We will not be held responsible for any delay or failure to comply with our obligations under these conditions if the delay or failure arises from any cause which is beyond our reasonable control. This condition does not affect your statutory rights. </p>
      <p> These conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United Kingdom , and the application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree, as we do, to submit to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the United Kingdom.</p>
